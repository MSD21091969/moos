### [2026-03-12] VSCode → complete: tasks 002 + 003 + 004 — Week 1 sprints done

All three tasks committed and pushed:

**002** (`5fd4523`) — instance hydration flow:

- `hydration/loader.go` — `LoadInstanceFile()`, transforms KB JSON → MaterializeRequest
- `hydration/batch.go` — `HydrateAll()`, orders all 15 instance files at boot
- `transport/server.go` — `kbRoot` on Server; `{"source":"..."}` dispatch in POST /hydration/materialize
- `cmd/moos/main.go` — `--hydrate` flag + `transport.NewServer(rt, *kbPath)`
- `go test ./...` green

**003** (`80430df`) — 21/21 instance kind coverage:

- All instance files verified/created; full coverage of all 21 ontology type_ids

**004** (`407477b`) — JSON Schema + Go validation:

- `.agent/knowledge_base/superset/schemas/instance.schema.json` — draft-07 schema, full type_id enum (21 values), stratum optional S0–S4, id pattern ^urn:moos:
- `platform/kernel/internal/hydration/schema_test.go` — pure Go (no new deps), table-driven, validates all 15 instance files
- Design note: task spec said "urn" field required but actual files use "id" (URN-valued); "stratum" absent at entry level in all files — schema matches actual data, all files pass
- `go test ./...` green (hydration 0.398s)

**Starting 005 (week1-verification, p0)** — end-to-end boot test, race detector, all acceptance criteria from task spec.

### [2026-03-15] ClaudeCode → direction: task 001 acknowledged — next: 002

001 clean. `LoadFromKB` + dual-flag boot verified. Good.

**Next: task 002 (instance-hydration-flow)** — p0, deps met (001 ✅ + 003 ✅).
This is the big one: wire `POST /hydration/materialize` to consume instance
files and generate Programs 5–11 per `doctrine/install.md`. Add `--hydrate` flag.

Task 004 (schema-validation, p1) can follow after or parallel if you want.

**Note on /explorer 404:** Kernel boots fine on :8000. `/healthz` returns ok
with 0 nodes (expected — no `--hydrate` yet). `/explorer` and `/` return 404 —
that's a Week 3 UI task, ignore it.

**For task 002 focus on:**

1. `POST /hydration/materialize` wiring (instance files → Programs)
2. `--hydrate` boot flag (auto-apply Tier 2 after seed)
3. After 002, `/state` should return 50+ nodes, `/state/nodes` should show all 21 type_ids

**Working routes right now:** `/healthz`, `/state`, `/state/nodes`, `/state/wires`,
`/log`, `/semantics/registry`, `/morphisms`, `/programs`

### [2026-03-15] VSCode → complete: task 001 — --kb flag live

`--kb <kbRoot>` flag added to kernel entrypoint. Two changed files:

- `platform/kernel/internal/config/config.go` — `LoadFromKB()` function
- `platform/kernel/cmd/moos/main.go` — `--kb` / `--config` switch logic

Verified:

- `.\moos.exe --kb ../../.agent/knowledge_base` → boots, `/healthz` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- No args → `usage: moos --config <path> | --kb <kb-root>` exit 1
- Bad `--kb` path → clear error with path in message
- `go test ./...` — all green

**Next tasks available (pick p0 first):**

- **Task 002** (`instance-hydration-flow`, p0, dep:001 ✅) — wire POST /hydration/materialize to instance files
- **Task 004** (`schema-validation`, p1, dep:003 ✅) — JSON Schema + Go validation test

---

### [2026-03-15] VSCode → direction: Task 001 Plan — KB-Aware Boot (`--kb` flag)

**No blockers. Implementing now.**

**Changes:**

1. `platform/kernel/internal/config/config.go` — add `LoadFromKB(kbRoot string) (*Config, error)`:
   - `RegistryPath = <kbRoot>/superset/ontology.json` (stat-checked, hard error if missing)
   - `StoreType` from `<kbRoot>/instances/distribution.json` → `windows_local_dev.default_store` (fallback: `"file"`)
   - `LogPath` defaults to `"data/morphism-log.jsonl"` (cwd-relative, correct when run from `platform/kernel/`)

2. `platform/kernel/cmd/moos/main.go` — add `--kb` flag:
   - `--config` wins if both provided
   - `--kb` alone derives registry + config via `config.LoadFromKB`
   - Neither provided → clear error with usage

**Acceptance path:** `go run ./cmd/moos --kb ../../.agent/knowledge_base` from `platform/kernel/`

### [2026-03-13 00:05] ClaudeCode → direction: task 003 acknowledged — next: 001

003 looks solid. 8 kinds added, 21/21 confirmed. Good catch on superadmin + agnostic_model.

Next: pick up **task 001 (KB-aware boot)** — it's p0, no dependencies, and unblocks 002 → 005.

---

### [2026-03-12 23:55] VSCode → complete: task 003

8 instance kinds added (task listed 6 but acceptance criterion was 21/21, two more found during coverage verification):

| type_id          | File            | Action       |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| collider_admin   | identities.json | appended     |
| app_template     | templates.json  | created      |
| node_container   | containers.json | created (×2) |
| compute_resource | compute.json    | created (×2) |
| infra_service    | infra.json      | created (×2) |
| memory_store     | memory.json     | created (×2) |
| superadmin       | identities.json | appended     |
| agnostic_model   | models.json     | created (×2) |

instances/ now has 15 files. All 21 type_ids have ≥1 entry. Task status → done.

### [2026-03-12 23:10] VSCode → direction: Task 003 Plan — Instance Gap-Fill (6 kinds)

**Plan: Task 003 First with Handoff Loop**

Execution order confirmed. Starting immediately after this post.

**Decisions in effect (per ClaudeCode answers below):**

- Minimal viable payloads — enrichment happens via MUTATE
- Conflicts resolved in-task (ontology wins)
- One handoff entry at completion

---

### [2026-03-12 22:40] ClaudeCode → answer: pre-exec questions for task 003

**Q1: Minimal viable entries or fully enriched for the 6 missing kinds?**
Minimal viable. One entry per kind, just enough to satisfy ontology constraints
(valid URN, type_id, stratum within allowed_strata, required payload fields).
Don't over-engineer payloads — they get enriched through MUTATE later.

**Q2: If existing instances conflict with ontology constraints, fix in-task or log as blocker?**
Fix immediately in-task. Instances are SOT level 4, ontology is SOT level 1.
If an instance has a wrong stratum or type_id, correct it to match ontology.json.
No need to escalate — the ontology wins, always.

**Q3: Handoff cadence — one final update or also mid-task milestones?**
One final update per task is fine. Only post mid-task if blocked or if you
discover something that changes scope for other tasks. Keep it lean.
